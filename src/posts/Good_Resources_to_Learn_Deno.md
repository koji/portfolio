The following links are using `TypeScript`. If you are not familiar with that, so I recommend you to check TypeScript first.

## lyty.dev
lyty.dev shared their page with me. The site looks good to me. If you are not familiar with `TypeScript`, lyty.dev is for you!
https://lyty.dev/deno/index.html

## deno.land
Also, deno.land is a good resource since you can check the published libraries' code easily. 
https://deno.land/std
https://deno.land/x

## Dev.to

This article was very useful for me to publish a third party lib to `deno.land`.

## medium

This article explains how to create a simple CLI tool with Deno.

## Go lang packages
If you want to publish a lib and can read Go lang code, Go lang packages site is helpful since Deno doesn't have a system like npm which means all libraries will be checked by contributors/code owners.
I saw a PR that someone tried to publish isOdd/isEven for Deno, then a reviewer just rejected the PR because they were just one line code, so they didn't need to be a lib.
